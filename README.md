Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new folder then make a project in the current directory
pnpm create svelte@latest

# or create a new project in my-app
pnpm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project, execute `pnpm i`  to install dependencies, then start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
